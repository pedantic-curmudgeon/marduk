# Could just push a marduk:tests image with the command in it? That way don't
# have to do anything crazy to get the tests to run via actions?
# But what about surfacing the deliverable?
# Can GitHub just get that as an artifact for me from the volume by referencing
# the filesystem path?

# Progress: Figured out how to publish an image. [Done]

# Next: Figure out how to retrieve the image. [Done]

# Next: Figure out how to issue commands to a container from the image. [Done]

# Next: Figure out how to retrieve an artifact from the image. [Done]

# Next: Figure out how to publish the testing artifact in a visible way. [Done]

# https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action

# Need to pass the artifact between jobs to expose to publisher?
# Would basically add an extra job, copy the deliverable from the second job,
# and then make it available from the third job?

# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts

# This can be done by either 1) downloading the artifact (defaults to CWD)
# or 2) copying the artifact to a folder under the CWD for easier publiction.

# Is there a better third option with the files options for the unit-test-result-action?
# The wildcard system seems very confusing to me.
